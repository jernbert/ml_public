This repo is to demonstrate basic skills in machine learning, such as Pandas and Keras. Its contents are taken from an assignment I have had this autumn (2024) in ML. The main notebook, located in the folder `Notebooks`, has a part about supervised learning and another about unsupervised learning which I have solved. In the first task, I make use of a yaml-file for the model configurations and this is found in the folder `model_configurations`.
