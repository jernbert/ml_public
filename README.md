This repo is to demonstrate basic skills in machine learning, such as Pandas and Keras. Its contents are taken from an assignment I have had this autumn (2024). The main notebook, located in the folder `Notebooks`, has a part about supervised learning and another about unsupervised learning. In the first task, I make use of a yaml-file for the model configurations. This is found in the folder `model_configurations`. 

Since the main notebook has some quite long outputs, I have added an HTML-version of it with manually shortened outputs for better readability.
